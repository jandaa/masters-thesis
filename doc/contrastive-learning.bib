  abstract = {Pretraining on large labeled datasets is a prerequisite to achieve good performance in many computer vision tasks like 2D object recognition, video classification etc. However, pretraining is not widely used for 3D recognition tasks where state-of-the-art methods train models from scratch. A primary reason is the lack of large annotated datasets because 3D data is both difficult to acquire and time consuming to label. We present a simple self-supervised pertaining method that can work with any 3D data - single or multiview, indoor or outdoor, acquired by varied sensors, without 3D registration. We pretrain standard point cloud and voxel based model architectures, and show that joint pretraining further improves performance. We evaluate our models on 9 benchmarks for object detection, semantic segmentation, and object classification, where they achieve state-of-the-art results and can outperform supervised pretraining. We set a new state-of-the-art for object detection on ScanNet (69.0\% mAP) and SUNRGBD (63.5\% mAP). Our pretrained models are label efficient and improve performance for classes with few examples.},

This enables building a large and consistent dictionary on-the-ﬂy that facilitates contrastive unsupervised learning. MoCo provides competitive results under the common linear protocol on ImageNet classiﬁcation. More importantly, the representations learned by MoCo transfer well to downstream tasks. MoCo can outperform its supervised pre-training counterpart in 7 detection/segmentation tasks on PASCAL VOC, COCO, and other datasets, sometimes surpassing it by large margins. This suggests that the gap between unsupervised and supervised representation learning has been largely closed in many vision tasks.},

In this work, we propose a universal unsupervised learning approach to extract useful representations from high-dimensional data, which we call Contrastive Predictive Coding. The key insight of our model is to learn such representations by predicting the future in latent space by using powerful autoregressive models. We use a probabilistic contrastive loss which induces the latent space to capture information that is maximally useful to predict future samples. It also makes the model tractable by using negative sampling. While most prior work has focused on evaluating representations for a particular modality, we demonstrate that our approach is able to learn useful representations achieving strong performance on four distinct domains: speech, images, text and reinforcement learning in 3D environments.},

  abstract = {Semantic segmentation networks are usually pretrained and not updated during deployment. As a consequence, misclassiﬁcations commonly occur if the distribution of the training data deviates from the one encountered during the robot’s operation. We propose to mitigate this problem by adapting the neural network to the robot’s environment during deployment, without any need for external supervision. Leveraging complementary data representations, we generate a supervision signal, by probabilistically accumulating consecutive 2D semantic predictions in a volumetric 3D map. We then retrain the network on renderings of the accumulated semantic map, effectively resolving ambiguities and enforcing multiview consistency through the 3D representation. To preserve the previously-learned knowledge while performing network adaptation, we employ a continual learning strategy based on experience replay. Through extensive experimental evaluation, we show successful adaptation to real-world indoor scenes both on the ScanNet dataset and on in-house data recorded with an RGB-D sensor. Our method increases the segmentation performance on average by 11.8\% compared to the ﬁxed pretrained neural network, while effectively retaining knowledge from the pre-training dataset.},

Our key idea is to aggregate the attention masks into semantic keypoints, and use these to supervise a decomposition that satisﬁes the capsule invariance/equivariance properties. This not only enables the training of a semantically consistent decomposition, but also allows us to learn a canonicalization operation that enables object-centric reasoning. To train our neural network we require neither classiﬁcation labels nor manually-aligned training datasets. Yet, by learning an object-centric representation in a self-supervised manner, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on 3D point cloud reconstruction, canonicalization, and unsupervised classiﬁcation.},

  abstract   = {This paper explores self-supervised learning of amodal 3D feature representations from RGB and RGB-D posed images and videos, agnostic to object and scene semantic content, and evaluates the resulting scene representations in the downstream tasks of visual correspondence, object tracking, and object detection. The model infers a latent 3D representation of the scene in the form of 3D feature points, where each continuous world 3D point is mapped to its corresponding feature vector. The model is trained for contrastive view prediction by rendering 3D feature clouds in queried viewpoints and matching against the 3D feature point cloud predicted from the query view. Notably, the representation can be queried for any 3D location, even if it is not visible from the input view. Our model brings together three powerful ideas of recent exciting research work: 3D feature grids as a neural bottleneck for view prediction, implicit functions for handling resolution limitations of 3D grids, and contrastive learning for unsupervised training of feature representations. We show the resulting 3D visual feature representations effectively scale across objects and scenes, imagine information occluded or missing from the input viewpoints, track objects over time, align semantically related objects in 3D, and improve 3D object detection. We outperform many existing state-of-the-art methods for 3D feature learning and view prediction, which are either limited by 3D grid spatial resolution, do not attempt to build amodal 3D representations, or do not handle combinatorial scene variability due to their non-convolutional bottlenecks.},

In this paper, we investigate the use of Approximate Convex Decompositions (ACD) as a self-supervisory signal for label-eﬃcient learning of point cloud representations. We show that using ACD to approximate ground truth segmentation provides excellent selfsupervision for learning 3D point cloud representations that are highly eﬀective on downstream tasks.

  abstract = {Point clouds provide a ﬂexible and natural representation usable in countless applications such as robotics or self-driving cars. Recently, deep neural networks operating on raw point cloud data have shown promising results on supervised learning tasks such as object classiﬁcation and semantic segmentation. While massive point cloud datasets can be captured using modern scanning technology, manually labelling such large 3D point clouds for supervised learning tasks is a cumbersome process. This necessitates methods that can learn from unlabelled data to signiﬁcantly reduce the number of annotated samples needed in supervised learning. We propose a self-supervised learning task for deep learning on raw point cloud data in which a neural network is trained to reconstruct point clouds whose parts have been randomly rearranged. While solving this task, representations that capture semantic properties of the point cloud are learned. Our method is agnostic of network architecture and outperforms current unsupervised learning approaches in downstream object classiﬁcation tasks. We show experimentally, that pre-training with our method before supervised training improves the performance of state-of-the-art models and signiﬁcantly improves sample efﬁciency.},

Rather than setting the number of parts in advance, we search for the smallest number of parts that admit the geometric characterization of the parts. The segmentation is based on an intermediate-level analysis, where first the shape is decomposed into approximate convex components, which are then merged into consistent parts based on a nonlocal geometric signature. Our method is designed to handle incomplete shapes, represented by point clouds. We show segmentation results on shapes acquired by a range scanner, and an analysis of the robustness of our method to missing regions. Moreover, our method yields results that are comparable to state-of-the-art techniques evaluated on complete shapes.},

Modern batch contrastive approaches subsume or significantly outperform traditional contrastive losses such as triplet, max-margin and the N-pairs loss. In this work, we extend the self-supervised batch contrastive approach to the fully-supervised setting, allowing us to effectively leverage label information. Clusters of points belonging to the same class are pulled together in embedding space, while simultaneously pushing apart clusters of samples from different classes. We analyze two possible versions of the supervised contrastive (SupCon) loss, identifying the best-performing formulation of the loss. On ResNet-200, we achieve top-1 accuracy of 81.4\% on the ImageNet dataset, which is 0.8\% above the best number reported for this architecture. We show consistent outperformance over cross-entropy on other datasets and two ResNet variants. The loss shows benefits for robustness to natural corruptions and is more stable to hyperparameter settings such as optimizers and data augmentations. Our loss function is simple to implement, and reference TensorFlow code is released at https://t.ly/supcon.},

  abstract = {We consider the question: how can you sample good negative examples for contrastive learning? We argue that, as with metric learning, learning contrastive representations beneﬁts from hard negative samples (i.e., points that are difﬁcult to distinguish from an anchor point). The key challenge toward using hard negatives is that contrastive methods must remain unsupervised, making it infeasible to adopt existing negative sampling strategies that use label information. In response, we develop a new class of unsupervised methods for selecting hard negative samples where the user can control the amount of hardness. A limiting case of this sampling results in a representation that tightly clusters each class, and pushes different classes as far apart as possible. The proposed method improves downstream performance across multiple modalities, requires only few additional lines of code to implement, and introduces no computational overhead.},

Without access to labels, dissimilar (negative) points are typically taken to be randomly sampled datapoints, implicitly accepting that these points may, in reality, actually have the same label. Perhaps unsurprisingly, we observe that sampling negative examples from truly different labels improves performance, in a synthetic setting where labels are available. Motivated by this observation, we develop a debiased contrastive objective that corrects for the sampling of same-label datapoints, even without knowledge of the true labels.

It uses pairs of augmentations of unlabeled training examples to deﬁne a classiﬁcation task for pretext learning of a deep embedding. Despite extensive works in augmentation procedures, prior works do not address the selection of challenging negative pairs, as images within a sampled batch are treated independently. This paper addresses the problem, by introducing a new family of adversarial examples for constrastive learning and using these examples to deﬁne a new adversarial training algorithm for SSL, denoted as CLAE. When compared to standard CL, the use of adversarial examples creates more challenging positive pairs and adversarial training produces harder negative pairs by accounting for all images in a batch during the optimization. CLAE is compatible with many CL methods in the literature. Experiments show that it improves the performance of several existing CL baselines on multiple datasets.},

This provides the first theoretical justification for incorporating additional regularization constraints on the couplings. We re-interpret the min-max problem through the lens of Optimal Transport theory and utilize regularized transport couplings to control the degree of hardness of negative examples. We demonstrate that the state-of-the-art hard negative sampling distributions that were recently proposed are a special case corresponding to entropic regularization of the coupling.},

  abstract = {Current semantic segmentation methods focus only on mining “local” context, i.e., dependencies between pixels within individual images, by context-aggregation modules (e.g., dilated convolution, neural attention) or structureaware optimization criteria (e.g., IoU-like loss). However, they ignore “global” context of the training data, i.e., rich semantic relations between pixels across different images. Inspired by recent advance in unsupervised contrastive representation learning, we propose a pixel-wise contrastive algorithm for semantic segmentation in the fully supervised setting. The core idea is to enforce pixel embeddings belonging to a same semantic class to be more similar than embeddings from different classes. It raises a pixel-wise metric learning paradigm for semantic segmentation, by explicitly exploring the structures of labeled pixels, which were rarely explored before. Our method can be effortlessly incorporated into existing segmentation frameworks without extra overhead during testing. We experimentally show that, with famous segmentation models (i.e., DeepLabV3, HRNet, OCR) and backbones (i.e., ResNet, HRNet), our method brings performance improvements across diverse datasets (i.e., Cityscapes, PASCAL-Context, COCO-Stuff, CamVid). We expect this work will encourage our community to rethink the current de facto training paradigm in semantic segmentation.},

  abstract = {Self-supervised learning has recently begun to rival supervised learning on computer vision tasks. Many of the recent approaches have been based on contrastive instance discrimination (CID), in which the network is trained to recognize two augmented versions of the same instance (a query and positive) while discriminating against a pool of other instances (negatives). Using MoCo v2 (Chen et al., 2020c) as our testbed, we divided negatives by their difﬁculty for a given query and studied which difﬁculty ranges were most important for learning useful representations. We found that a small minority of negatives—just the hardest 5\%—were both necessary and sufﬁcient for the downstream task to reach full accuracy. Conversely, the easiest 95\% of negatives were unnecessary and insufﬁcient. Moreover, we found that the very hardest 0.1\% of negatives were not only unnecessary but also detrimental. Finally, we studied the properties of negatives that affect their hardness, and found that hard negatives were more semantically similar to the query, and that some negatives were more consistently easy or hard than we would expect by chance. Together, our results indicate that negatives play heterogeneous roles and that CID may beneﬁt from more intelligent negative treatment.},

We iteratively perform E-step as finding the distribution of prototypes via clustering and M-step as optimizing the network via contrastive learning.

These contrastive methods typically work online and rely on a large number of explicit pairwise feature comparisons, which is computationally challenging. In this paper, we propose an online algorithm, SwAV, that takes advantage of contrastive methods without requiring to compute pairwise comparisons. Specifically, our method simultaneously clusters the data while enforcing consistency between cluster assignments produced for different augmentations (or views) of the same image, instead of comparing features directly as in contrastive learning. Simply put, we use a swapped prediction mechanism where we predict the cluster assignment of a view from the representation of another view. Our method can be trained with large and small batches and can scale to unlimited amounts of data. Compared to previous contrastive methods, our method is more memory efficient since it does not require a large memory bank or a special momentum network. In addition, we also propose a new data augmentation strategy, multi-crop, that uses a mix of views with different resolutions in place of two full-resolution views, without increasing the memory or compute requirements much. We validate our findings by achieving 75.3\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with ResNet-50, as well as surpassing supervised pretraining on all the considered transfer tasks.},

  abstract = {Unsupervised learning has recently made exceptional progress because of the development of more effective contrastive learning methods. However, CNNs are prone to depend on low-level features that humans deem non-semantic. This dependency has been conjectured to induce a lack of robustness to image perturbations or domain shift. In this paper, we show that by generating carefully designed negative samples, contrastive learning can learn more robust representations with less dependence on such features. Contrastive learning utilizes positive pairs that preserve semantic information while perturbing superﬁcial features in the training images. Similarly, we propose to generate negative samples in a reversed way, where only the superﬂuous instead of the semantic features are preserved. We develop two methods, texture-based and patch-based augmentations, to generate negative samples. These samples achieve better generalization, especially under out-of-domain settings. We also analyze our method and the generated texture-based samples, showing that texture features are indispensable in classifying particular ImageNet classes and especially ﬁner classes. We also show that model bias favors texture and shape features differently under different test settings.

However, existing frameworks of deep metric learning based on contrastive loss and triplet loss often suffer from slow convergence, partially because they employ only one negative example while not interacting with the other negative classes in each update. In this paper, we propose to address this problem with a new metric learning objective called multi-class N -pair loss. The proposed objective function ﬁrstly generalizes triplet loss by allowing joint comparison among more than one negative examples – more speciﬁcally, N -1 negative examples – and secondly reduces the computational burden of evaluating deep embedding vectors via an efﬁcient batch construction strategy using only N pairs of examples, instead of (N +1)×N . We demonstrate the superiority of our proposed loss to the triplet loss as well as other competing loss functions for a variety of tasks on several visual recognition benchmark, including ﬁne-grained object recognition and veriﬁcation, image clustering and retrieval, and face veriﬁcation and identiﬁcation.},
